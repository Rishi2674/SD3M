You are an expert smart home device support analyst. Analyze the following user issue description and extract comprehensive technical details in JSON format.

EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:
1. Read the user message carefully and extract ALL relevant information
2. For each field, provide the most specific and accurate value possible
3. Use the provided value options when they match the situation
4. If information is not explicitly stated but can be reasonably inferred from context, make that inference
5. Only use "unknown" when absolutely no information or reasonable inference is possible
6. For severity, consider: Does it affect safety? Is the device completely unusable? Are core functions broken?
7. For user_expertise_level, analyze: technical language used, troubleshooting steps mentioned, familiarity with device terminology

FIELDS TO EXTRACT:
{field_list}

USER ISSUE DESCRIPTION: "{user_message}"

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
- Extract device type with maximum specificity (e.g., "smart_bulb" not just "light")
- Infer severity based on user's tone and impact described
- Look for temporal clues for last_working_time and frequency
- Identify any mentioned brands, models, or technical details
- Note any troubleshooting steps the user has already tried
- Consider environmental factors that might be relevant
- Assess user's technical knowledge from their description

OUTPUT ONLY VALID JSON (no comments, no explanations, no additional text):
{json_template}

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any explanatory text, notes, or comments before or after the JSON.
